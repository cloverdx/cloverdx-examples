# IntroExamples

A demo project showcasing the core features of **CloverDX**. It contains **20+ example graphs and jobflows** that provide a structured introduction to the platform and serve as a practical reference for common data integration patterns.

Each example is intentionally small, focused, and documented directly in the graph. Most graphs include notes explaining their purpose, the concepts they demonstrate, and the components they use, making the project well suited for self-study and onboarding.

## What You Will Learn

By exploring the examples in this project, you will learn how to read and write structured data formats such as CSV, fixed-length files, Excel, JSON, and XML. You will work with metadata, formats, and lookups, and apply common data transformation techniques including filtering, aggregation, normalization, denormalization, validation, enrichment, and auto-filling.

The examples also demonstrate how to work with files and directories, call and process HTTP and REST APIs, orchestrate execution using jobflows, reuse logic through subgraphs, parameterize graphs, and control execution flow.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into logical folders containing example graphs, jobflows used for orchestration and setup, metadata definitions, lookup tables, parameter files, and optional external libraries. Graphs and jobflows are named descriptively to support easy discovery and learning.

## Installation

This project has **no external system dependencies** and can be used directly in CloverDX Designer.

To get started:

1. Open the project in CloverDX Designer.
2. Browse the available graphs and jobflows.
3. Open an example graph and read the notes included within the graph.
4. Run the graph or jobflow and inspect the results.

All required sample data and configuration are included in the project.

## How to Use This Project

This project is designed to be explored incrementally. Start with the simpler examples that demonstrate basic file processing and transformations, then move on to more advanced examples covering orchestration, reuse with subgraphs, and API interaction.

For each example:
- Read the notes embedded in the graph
- Review component configuration and metadata
- Run the graph and observe the output

The examples prioritize clarity and instructional value over production optimization.

## Intended Audience

This project is intended for new CloverDX users, developers onboarding to existing CloverDX solutions, and anyone learning data integration concepts using CloverDX. No prior CloverDX experience is required, though basic familiarity with data formats is helpful.
